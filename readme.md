# Zabbix: EdgeMAX Template (SNMPv2)

This template allows you to quickly get up and running with monitoring of Ubiquiti's EdgeRouter line of devices. It allows for auto-discovering of network interfaces and automatically applies some triggers for the discovered network interfaces. Many more triggers are included but disabled by default. It also includes a modifed version of the default template "Generic by SNMP" to add graphs for packet loss and response time.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Select a branch according to your Zabbix version and download the xml.
2. Import *zbx_edgemax_template.xml* to Zabbix (Configuration -> Templates -> Import)
3. Add the template *EdgeMAX SNMPv2* to your host and configure 
   1. Add *{$SNMP_COMMUNITY}* to your host's macros and configure it. (default is usually public)
4. Enable the *SNMP* agent on your EdgeMAX device.
   1. Set *SNMP community* to the same value as your macro or the other way around.

## Issues
- [Wrong ethernet link status/speed via SNMP](https://community.ui.com/questions/Wrong-ethernet-link-status-speed-via-SNMP/6e50940c-3cc1-4242-9881-5c03e7892ebf)
  (some of this issue is due to how ubiquiti is treating "standard" SNMP OIDs. The link status should be fixed but the speed is still troublesome)
